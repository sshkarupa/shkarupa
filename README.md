### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with web development experience, mostly focused on server-side.

The technology stack I'm familiar / well versed with:

* Rack-based web-frameworks: Ruby o Rails, Sinatra, Grape
* Sequel ORM (grate ORM for non Rails app)
* Sidekiq
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* VueJS
* Authorization (Devise, OAuth, JWT)
* Authentication (CanCanCan, Pundit)
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Drone CI, Circle CI)
* Devops (docker, docker-compose, make scripting, Ansible, AWS services) - mostly for development

I believe that tests are an important part of the development. I prefer RSpec as the main test framework.

Apart from Ruby (and Ruby on Rails), I am also very interested in Elixir and Phoenix which are great for building concurrent and fault-tolerant systems.
